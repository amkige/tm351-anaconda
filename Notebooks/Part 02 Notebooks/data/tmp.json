Plus, security event Hack in the Box, and Welsh language now available on Microsoft's Bing.","long_synopsis":"The case of Mario Costeja Gonzalez, a Spaniard whose home was put up for auction 16 years ago because he was suffering financial difficulties, has just led to a ruling in the Court of Justice of the European Union forcing search engines to remove certain links from search results. Mr Gonzalez's request to have the details of his past deleted has led to a debate about the balance between the right to privacy and freedom of speech. Google has set up an expert committee to discuss how to deal with this thorny issue. Luciano Floridi, professor of Philosophy and Ethics of Information at the Oxford Internet Institute in England discusses how the committee should find a solution.  \r\n\r\nHack in the Box\r\nSecurity experts and hackers converged on Amsterdam in the Netherlands this week for the Hack in the Box event. Reporter Jonathan Kent talks to Gareth Mitchell about the event and discusses recent security attacks, like that of eBay recently, in which millions of people have had their personal details compromised and also a bug called Heartbleed which compromised the SSL protocol for transmitting private information across the internet. \r\n\r\nMachine Translating Welsh \r\nThe Welsh Assembly has been working with Microsoft to use machine translation to produce official documents simultaneously in Welsh and English. It is keen to encourage the use of Welsh which is currently spoken by 20% of the population. Gareth meets the translation team in Cardiff. \r\n\r\n(Photo: A man surfs the internet \u00a9 AFP\/Getty)","first_broadcast_date":"2014-06-03T19:32:30+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Digital Planet","subtitle":"Privacy or Freedom of Speech?"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldserviceradio","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002w6r2","title":"Digital Planet","short_synopsis":"Technological and digital news from around the world.","media_type":null,"position":null,"image":{"pid":"p077rk45"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-13T10:32:30+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":786,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldserviceradio","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p01zdr24","title":"TV White Space in Ghana","first_broadcast_date":"2014-05-27T19:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0207qt1","title":"Goal-line Technology","first_broadcast_date":"2014-06-10T19:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p01ztvfq","duration":1710,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"BBC News: Google: Who would want the right to be forgotten?","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/magazine-27396981"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Professor Luciano Floridi","url":"http:\/\/www.oii.ox.ac.uk\/people\/?id=327"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Hack In The Box Amsterdam 2014","url":"http:\/\/haxpo.nl\/hitb2014ams-conference\/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"BBC News: Microsoft translation system to help more use Welsh","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-wales-26287296"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT009","key":"magazinesandreviews","title":"Magazines & Reviews","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00064","key":"scienceandnature","title":"Science & Nature","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
